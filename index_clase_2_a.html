                            A Covid therapy derived from a llama
                            named Fifi has shown "significant potential" in early trials.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is a treatment made of "nanobodies", small, simpler versions of antibodies,
                            which llamas and camels produce naturally in response to infection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once the therapy has been tested in humans, scientists say,
                            it could be given as a simple nasal spray - to treat and even prevent early
                            infection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prof James Naismith described nanobodies as "fantastically exciting".
                        </p>

                                <p>Prof Naismith, who is one of the lead researchers and director of the
                                    Rosalind
                                    Franklin Institute in Oxfordshire, explained that coronavirus-infected
                                    rodents
                                    treated with the new nanobody
                                    nasal spray fully recovered within six days.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The treatment has, so far, been tested only in those lab animals, but Public
                                    Health England said it was
                                    among the "most effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralising agents" it had ever
                                    tested.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This apparent covid-fighting
                                    potency comes from the strength with which nanobodies bind to the virus.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Just like our own antibodies, virus-specific nanobodies
                                    latch on to and bind to viruses and bacteria that invade our bodies.
                                    This binding essentially tags an invading virus with an immune "red flag",
                                    to
                                    allow
                                    the rest of the body's immune armoury to target it for destruction.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The nanobodies that these researchers produced -
                                    with the help of a llama's immune system - bind particularly tightly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "That's where we had some help from
                                    Fifi the 'Franklin [Institute] llama'," explained Prof Naismith.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    By vaccinating Fifi with a tiny, non-infectious piece of the viral protein,
                                    the scientists stimulated her immune system to make the special molecules.
                                    The scientists then carefully picked out and purified the most potent
                                    nanobodies
                                    in a sample of Fifi's blood;
                                    those that matched the viral protein most closely,
                                    like the key that best fits a specific lock.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The team was then
                                    able to grow large quantities of the specially selected, most potent
                                    molecules.
                                </p>

                                        Prof Naismith told BBC News: "The immune system√ß
                                        is so marvellous that it still does better than we can - evolution is
                                        hard to beat."
                                    </p>

                                <div>
                                    <p>
                                        Professor Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist
                                        from the University of Manchester said the new development was
                                        "exciting but still quite early".
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        "We need more data on efficacy and safety before we move to human
                                        trials,"
                                        she added. "However it's very promising nonetheless
                                        and the fact it may be cheaper and easier
                                        to administer is a plus. Covid-19 will be, unfortunately,
                                        with us for a while yet, so more treatments will be needed."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Professor Naismith and his collaborators, who published
                                        their research in the journal Nature Communications agreed that,
                                        even with the success of the Covid vaccines,
                                        having effective treatments in the future would be very important.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        "Not all of the world is being vaccinated at the same speed,"
                                        he said, "and there remains a risk of new variants capable of
                                        bypassing vaccine immunity emerging."
                                    </p>

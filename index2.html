                                    A Covid therapy derived from a llama
                                    named Fifi has shown "significant potential" in early trials.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is a treatment made of "nanobodies", small, simpler versions of antibodies,
                                    which llamas and camels produce naturally in response to infection.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once the therapy has been tested in humans, scientists say,
                                    it could be given as a simple nasal spray - to treat and even prevent early
                                    infection.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Prof James Naismith described nanobodies as "fantastically exciting".
                                </p>

                                        <p>Prof Naismith, who is one of the lead researchers and director of the
                                            Rosalind
                                            Franklin Institute in Oxfordshire, explained that coronavirus-infected
                                            rodents
                                            treated with the new nanobody
                                            nasal spray fully recovered within six days.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The treatment has, so far, been tested only in those lab animals, but Public
                                            Health England said it was
                                            among the "most effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralising agents" it had ever
                                            tested.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This apparent covid-fighting
                                            potency comes from the strength with which nanobodies bind to the virus.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Just like our own antibodies, virus-specific nanobodies
                                            latch on to and bind to viruses and bacteria that invade our bodies.
                                            This binding essentially tags an invading virus with an immune "red flag",
                                            to
                                            allow
                                            the rest of the body's immune armoury to target it for destruction.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The nanobodies that these researchers produced -
                                            with the help of a llama's immune system - bind particularly tightly.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            "That's where we had some help from
                                            Fifi the 'Franklin [Institute] llama'," explained Prof Naismith.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            By vaccinating Fifi with a tiny, non-infectious piece of the viral protein,
                                            the scientists stimulated her immune system to make the special molecules.
                                            The scientists then carefully picked out and purified the most potent
                                            nanobodies
                                            in a sample of Fifi's blood;
                                            those that matched the viral protein most closely,
                                            like the key that best fits a specific lock.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The team was then
                                            able to grow large quantities of the specially selected, most potent
                                            molecules.
                                        </p>

                                                Prof Naismith told BBC News: "The immune systemç
                                                is so marvellous that it still does better than we can - evolution is
                                                hard to beat."
                                            </p>

                                                Professor Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist
                                                from the University of Manchester said the new development was
                                                "exciting but still quite early".
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                "We need more data on efficacy and safety before we move to human
                                                trials,"
                                                she added. "However it's very promising nonetheless
                                                and the fact it may be cheaper and easier
                                                to administer is a plus. Covid-19 will be, unfortunately,
                                                with us for a while yet, so more treatments will be needed."

                                                their research in the journal Nature Communications agreed that,
                                                even with the success of the Covid vaccines,
                                                having effective treatments in the future would be very important.
